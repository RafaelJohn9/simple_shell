# Want to compare projects ?ðŸ˜Š

## Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RafaelJohn9/simple_shell
```

### Then Run

```bash
./shell
```

to start the shell

### To generate another executable using `gcc`

#### 1. Open your terminal or command prompt

#### 2. Run the following command

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o shell
```

Here's a breakdown of the command and its flags:

- `-Wall`: Enables all warning messages.
- `-Werror`: Treats all warnings as errors.
- `-Wextra`: Enables additional warning messages.
- `-pedantic`: Enforces strict adherence to the C language standard.
- `-std=gnu89`: Specifies the C language standard to use (GNU C89).

If there are no errors, the `gcc` compiler will generate an executable file with the specified name in the same directory.

#### And now you can compare projects ðŸ˜‰

*In case of anything just open an **issue**, we would really appreciate that.*

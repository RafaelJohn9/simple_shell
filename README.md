## Why the shell ?

`What I cannot create, I do not understand.
Know how to solve every problem that has been solved` ~ *Richard Feynman*

For every philosophy there is some truth to  it and for this one we completely agree.

A shell is a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** that allows users to **interact** with the **operating system**. It serves as an intermediary between the user and the operating system, enabling users:

- to execute commands
- run programs
- and manage system resources.

### With this project we learnt

- how [processes are managed by the OS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-process-management/)

- [system calls](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-system-call/)

- [input/output handling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-input-output-interface/)

- [command parsing](https://bito.ai/resources/c-parse-string-c-string-explained/)

- [job control](https://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/Manuals/glibc-2.2.3/html_chapter/libc_27.html)

- [signal handling](https://medium.com/@razika28/signals-ad83f38f80b6)

- [file system interaction](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/basics-file-handling-c/
)
- [error handling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/error-handling-in-c/)

As much as we would love to dwelve into [history](https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/l-linux-shells/), we are not trying to bore you with a lecture on it and so, let's get started with project roadmap and structure.

## Roadmap

We created a *14-day roadmap* which we used to create a shell and we would like to share it since its simple and reduces the workload when it comes to research and creating your own shell.
